# Node.js / Express template

This template provides:

* A basic Express app in `index.js`
* `dotenv`, a sample env file (`.env.sample`) and a `config.js` file to export config variables
* ESLint with Airbnb rules
* Prettier
* Automatic linting on commit: **you can't commit if you have ESLint errors**

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: `npm install` (alternatively, you can use Yarn or PNPM)
2. Copy `.env.sample` as `.env` and adjust it to your needs
3. Start the app on your local machine: `npm run start:dev`
